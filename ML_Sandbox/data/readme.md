## File naming logic

- ymount = Your mount (person wearing the sensor has the mount top position)

- ysc = Your side control

- ybc = Your back control

- ycg = Your closed guard

- omount = Opponent mount (person wearing the sensor is on the bottom of the mount)

- osc = Opponent side control

- obc = Opponent back control

- ocg = Opponent closed guard

All tests follow the follow sequence unless otherwise stated in the file name:

ybc --> ymount --> ysd --> ycg --> ocg --> osc --> omount --> obc
